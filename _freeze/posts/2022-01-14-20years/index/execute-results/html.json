(2004)</a>\n\n![The Bioconductor website in 2002.](bioconductor-website-2002.png)\n\nOK, well, taking a brief look at the Wayback machine snapshot, let's just take a second to acknowledge that at its inception (Bioconductor Release 1.0: May 2, 2002), the Bioconductor project included just 15 packages, broadly classified as:\n\n- annotation\n- data management and organization\n- differential expression\n- analysis of microarray data\n- visualisation and normalisation of microarray data\n- storage and retrieval of large datasets\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Bioconductor project is now (Bioconductor 3.14; October 27, 2021) strong of:\n\n- 2083 software packages\n- 408 experiment data packages\n- 904 annotation packages\n- 29 workflows\n- 8 books\n\nThat is about 1 new package every other day for the past twenty years. Way to go!\n\n![The Bioconductor website in 2022.](bioconductor-website-2022.png)\n\nThat collection of core-maintained and community-contributed packages has grown so large that there is now an entire hierarchy of terms to categorise those packages, called [BiocViews][biocviews-website].\nCheck them out!\n\nBut the Bioconductor project has grown to become so much more than a collection of software packages for bioinformatics.\nThe success of the Bioconductor project has also grown a welcoming and inclusive community made of a [Core Team][bioc-core-team], package developers, and users of all backgrounds and experience levels.\nI am reminded daily of this friendly, active, and stimulating environment through the [Slack workspace][bioc-slack], the [Support site][bioc-support-website], and the [YouTube channel][bioc-youtube].\nOn top of that, regular events that bring the community together are the highlight of my calendar: the annual BioC conference in North America, the regional meetings in Europe ([EuroBioC][eurobioc-website]), Asia ([BioC Asia][biocasia-website]), and summer schools (e.g., [CSAMA][csama-website]).\n\nAnd speaking of conference, let me close on the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Bioconductor project, as a [collection of photos contributed by community members][slides-20years] presented during the BioC 2021 conference [Meet the Community Advisory Board (CAB) session][bioc2021-20years].\nI'm sure this will bring up memories for some of the earliest contributors to the Bioconductor project, and I hope that it will show even the most recent users how open and welcoming the Bioconductor community is!\n\n![Slides of photos celebrating 20 years of Bioconductor (link above).](cover.png)\n\n# References\n\n\n<p><cite><a id='bib-Gentleman2004'></a><a href=\"#cite-Gentleman2004\">Gentleman, R.
